# BME-205

This is a repository for the course BME 205: Bioinformatics Models and Algorithms, taught at UCSC and taken in fall 2017. The programs found in this repository cover bioinformatics models and algorithms: the use of computational techniques to convert the masses of information from biochemical experiments (DNA sequencing, DNA chips, and other high-throughput experimental methods) into useful information. Emphasis is on DNA and protein sequence alignment and analysis.
